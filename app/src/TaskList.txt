   Problem Statement
Please create a new Android project using Jetpack Compose (including a ViewModel) that shows a
 TODO: 1-minute countdown including seconds and milliseconds.

These are the mandatory requirements:
TODO 2* One label that shows the current timer value -->
TODO 3* Two buttons that can be clicked to start/pause and stop the timer
TODO 4* The timer should work correctly when the app is in the background
TODO 5* The ViewModel should use Flows / StateFlows for the implementation of the logic
TODO 6* The ViewModel should be created by dependency injection with Koin
TODO 7* You should solve IDE warnings and make sure there is no unnecessary code - in other words, the code should look production ready

and for extra points:
TODO 8* Your code should contain sufficient comments
TODO 9* The app should post a system notification when the timer ends if the app is in the background
TODO 10* The View shows an animated ring around the text and the button that shows the current state of the timer
